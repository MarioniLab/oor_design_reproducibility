# Disease-state identification with healthy single-cell references  

This repository contains notebooks and scripts to reproduce analyses benchmarking the use of control and atlas datasets as references for identification of disease-associated cell states (see [manuscript]()).

The workflow for disease-state identification and evaluation of out-of-reference detection is available as a [python package](https://github.com/emdann/oor_benchmark).

## Repository structure

- `metadata` - ciao
- `src` - contains notebooks and scripts 

## Data

Pre-processed datasets used in this analysis are available via [figshare](). For references of the original datasets collected see [study metadata](). 

- `PBMC_merged.normal.subsample500cells.clean_celltypes.h5ad` - harmonized object of healthy PBMC profiles from 12 studies, used for OOR identification benchmark with simulations
- For COVID-19 analysis
